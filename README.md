## Customization Guide

### For Each Application

1. **Replace Placeholders**:
   - `[Your Name]` → Your actual name
   - `[Your Email]` → Your contact email
   - `[Your GitHub]` → Your GitHub username/profile
   - `[Your fork URL]` → URL to your distributed-llama fork
   - `[Current Date]` → Today's date
   - `[Your experience]` → Your relevant background

2. **Add Specific Details**:
   - Current GitHub star count
   - Your specific expertise/background
   - Links to previous projects
   - Academic affiliation (if applicable)
   - Specific hardware you already have access to

3. **Tailor to Sponsor**:
   - Emphasize alignment with sponsor's mission
   - Highlight relevant metrics for that sponsor
   - Adjust tone (academic vs. commercial vs. community)

## Application Strategy

### High Probability (Apply Immediately)

1. **DigitalOcean** (80% approval)
   - Requirements: 100+ stars, open-source license
   - Value: $612/year
   - Use: Model hosting, documentation, CI/CD
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

2. **PyTorch Credits** (70% approval)
   - Requirements: PyTorch-based project
   - Value: $2,000
   - Use: CI/CD, performance testing
   - Timeline: 2-3 weeks

### Medium Probability (Worth Applying)

3. **Lambda Labs** (60% approval)
   - Requirements: Research proposal, clear impact
   - Value: $5,000
   - Use: Main development compute
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks

### Lower Probability (If Eligible)

4. **NAIRR Pilot** (40% if affiliated)
   - Requirements: US affiliation, institutional support
   - Value: Very high (free GPU access)
   - Timeline: 4-8 weeks

5. **NVIDIA Academic** (30% if academic)
   - Requirements: Academic institution, NVIDIA software use
   - Value: Up to 32,000 A100 hours
   - Timeline: 4-12 weeks

## Stacking Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: Apply to multiple programs simultaneously

```
DigitalOcean      → Infrastructure (storage, hosting)
                    ↓
PyTorch Credits   → Testing & CI/CD
                    ↓
Lambda Labs       → Development compute
                    ↓
NAIRR/NVIDIA      → Extended research (if eligible)
```

**Total Value**: $7,600+ in resources with no overlap

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't
- Apply with empty GitHub repository
- Submit generic, copy-paste applications
- Overcommit on timeline
- Underestimate resource needs
- Forget to customize for each sponsor

### ✅ Do
- Show genuine community demand (issues, stars)
- Provide specific technical details
- Include realistic timelines with buffer
- Demonstrate previous open-source work
- Follow up professionally

## After Approval

### Immediate Actions
1. Send thank you email
2. Update README with sponsor acknowledgment
3. Begin work according to proposed timeline
4. Set up tracking for deliverables

### Ongoing
1. Provide regular updates (per sponsor requirements)
2. Tag sponsor in social media posts
3. Document progress publicly
4. Engage with sponsor community

### Upon Completion
1. Final report to all sponsors
2. Public announcement with results
3. Thank you blog posts
4. Case study creation
5. Community testimonials

## Backup Plan

If no sponsorships approved:

### Self-Funded Approach
- **Week 1**: Use spot instances ($30-50)
- **Week 2-3**: Focus on optimization, minimal testing
- **Week 4**: Release with basic validation
- **Total Cost**: ~$145 with spot instances

### Community Crowdfunding
- **GitHub Sponsors**: Set up for ongoing support
- **Open Collective**: Transparent fund management
- **Ko-fi/Buy Me a Coffee**: One-time contributions

### Phased Development
1. **Phase 1**: Basic GLM support (self-funded)
2. **Phase 2**: Community validation
3. **Phase 3**: Reapply with proven results
